🔐 Authentication System – Secure Login & Signup Web App
This is a lightweight, full-stack user authentication project built to demonstrate secure login, signup, and user session handling. Designed using React.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MySQL for database operations, the system provides a clean and modular foundation for authentication workflows in modern web applications.

🌟 Core Features
📝 User Signup & Login
New users can register using a form that validates email, username, and password.

Existing users can log in with credentials stored securely in the database.

Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being saved in MySQL.

🔐 Authentication & Session Management
Secure login flow using Express sessions.

Logged-in users are maintained in an active session until logout.

Routes are protected to prevent unauthorized access.

📦 Backend APIs
RESTful API endpoints built with Express.

/signup and /login handle POST requests from the frontend.

SQL queries ensure real-time validation and data insertion.

💻 Frontend (React.js)
